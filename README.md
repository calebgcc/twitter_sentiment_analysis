# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression
The dataset is divided into two categories of tweets: positive (1) and negative (0).

In the positive tweets we find feelings of happiness, excitement, gratitude, in the negative tweets we find feelings of sadness, depression, anger.
The goal is to train a model that can classify the general sentiment of the tweet.

This example is easily translatable to other important uses of Sentiment Analysis such as classifying: sexist/racist tweets, positive/negative product reviews, or even fake/factual news.
